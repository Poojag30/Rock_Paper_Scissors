# Rock_Paper_Scissors
This C# program is a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game for two players. 

It begins by declaring variables for player inputs (`inputPlayer1` and `inputPlayer2`) and a variable to store a random number (`randomInt`). 

The program then enters a loop that allows the players to play multiple rounds until one player reaches a score of 3. 

Within each round, Player 1 is prompted to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Player 2's choice is generated randomly using the `Random` class. The program then compares the choices and determines the winner of that round, updating the scores accordingly.

After each round, the scores are displayed, and if one player reaches a score of 3, they are declared the winner. 

At the end of each game, the players are asked if they want to play again. If they choose to continue, the scores are reset, and the game starts over. If they choose to quit, the program exits.

Overall, this program provides a simple way for two players to play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
